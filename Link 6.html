            <h1>SU ties to Adventure Time</h1>
          <p>Before Steven Universe, Rebecca Sugar worked on Adventure Time, another Cartoon Network show. She stayed with Adventure Time for 5 seasons, and wrote some of audience's favourite songs. I've covered three of them in the video below.</p>

          <p>Once Rebecca Sugar established her reputation within Cartoon Network through her work on Adventure Time, she pitched Steven Universe. The show was green lit, and that's how it all started.</p>
          <p>One of the most interesting things I've noticed is that Rebecca was responsible for writing a song that the AT fandom has latched onto as the first hint that Marceline and Bubblegum may be more than friends: "I'm Just Your Problem". However, while AT has continued to strongly hint at their relationship, there has been nothing confirmed. Meanwhile, SU has, as we've already established, strong LGBTQ+ themes and positive representation. My theory is that Rebecca Sugar earned the confidence of the CN execuatives and was then able to get permission to create a show that would push even stronger progressive themes than AT.</p>
