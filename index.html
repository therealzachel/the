            <p>Steven Universe is an animated tv series on Cartoon Network created by Rebecca Sugar. It is a coming of age story centered around Steven Universe, a young boy growing up in Beach City with his dad and the Crystal Gems, who spend their time saving the world.</p>

            <p>Steven is half-gem / half-human, with a human father named Greg and a Crystal Gem mother named Rose Quartz. The 3 main Crystal Gems are Garnet, Pearl, and Amethyst. The Gems bodies are projections from their Gem, which means that they can change their appearance whenever they want; it also means that, when damaged enough, they will retreat into their Gem in order to recuperate and reform.</p>
            <p> Throughout the series, Steven explores how to use and control his emerging Gem powers through missions and adventures with the Crystal Gems. He also explores his humanity through his father and his relationship with his best friend, Connie.</p>
            <p>Once Steven begins to control his powers, the main conflict in the series becomes the Crystal Gems protecting Earth from Homeworld. Several thousand years ago, the Crystal Gems split from Homeworld and in a rebellion lead by Rose Quartz, fought to protect Earth from being mined for resources by Homeworld. Homeworld is ruled by the Diamonds, and has a strict Gem hierarchy. Now, Homeworld has focused on destroying Earth once again, and it’s up to the Crystal Gems to stop them. Two Homeworld Gems, Lapis Lazuli and Peridot, join the Crystal Gems in their fight to protect Earth.
</p>

<p>A few important things to note about the universe:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Fusion is when two Gems merge to form one being. For instance, Sardonyx is a Fusion of Pearl and Garnet. It is revealed midway through the series that Garnet herself is a Fusion of Ruby and Sapphire (I’ll discuss this in more detail later on). Interestingly, despite his half-human status, Steven can also Fuse - he often fuses with Connie to form Stevonnie, a personal favourite.</li>

              <li>An important storyline to note is the growing complexity of Steven’s relationship with his mother and her legacy. Because Rose Quartz gave up her form to create Steven (her Gem became his Gem), Steven has never known his mother. Recently, Steven has been grappling with several decisions his mother made, specifically in relation to a Gem named Bismuth. Rebecca’s depiction of Steven’s relationship with his mother’s legacy and what people expect of him is complex and realistic; it’s also a storyline they are currently exploring, so there are no answers to most of the questions he’s currently struggling with.
