            <p>Right off the bat, the song starts with referencing Garnet as a Fusion, emphasizing the strength of Ruby and Sapphire's relationship. It also emphasizes the idea that Garnet is made of two beings, which focuses on teamwork and compatibility as being the basis for a strong relationship.</p>
              <p>"Can't you see that my relationship is stable" is, again, a reference to the near-perfect Fusion that Ruby and Sapphire achieve because of the strength of their relationship. "I can see you hate the way we intermingle" is a reference to Jasper (and Homeworld's) prejudice against Fusions created from Gems that are not the same (such as a Ruby and a Sapphire instead of two Rubies) </p>
              <p> The third verse is Garnet's promise that she is stronger, and that she will not give up the fight. The secondary chorus of "I am made of love" blatantly confirms that Ruby and Sapphire's relationship is meant to be romantic, which gives representation to LGBTQ+ relationships in a healthy and positive light. </p>
              <p> "Cause I am a feeling and I will never end" references Garnet's philsophy that Fusion is an experience, and emphasizes the idea that she is the physical embodiment of their love.</p>
              <p>"But I am even more than the two of them / Everything they care about is what I am / I am their fury / I am their patience" once again references the idea that Garnet is the physical embodiment of their relationship, and that she is meant to have the best traits of both Ruby and Sapphire (however, she does also pick up some of their weaknesses). However, even though she also has some of their weaknesses, she is still stronger than each of them individually because they are better together. "I am a conversation" is my favourite line in the song because I think that's a great way to look at a relationship. I love the way that Steven Universe portrays LGBTQ+ relationships; however, Steven Universe is also stellar as presenting healthy relationship dynamics no matter what the sexuality, etc of those involved. Looking at love and relationships as a conversation promotes discussion, patience, and understanding between those involved, which promotes healthier relationship dynamics.</p>
