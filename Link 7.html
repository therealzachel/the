            <h1>Feminism in Steven Universe</h1>
            /audio recording/
            <p>*Transcipt of the above Audio Recording*</p>
            <p>Steven Universe is regarded as a strongly feminist show. While the Gems do not have a gender in the sense that they aren’t human, they are all female presenting and use she/her pronouns. Steven and Greg are the only two main characters who are male, and they tend to defy traditional gender stereotypes, which I’ll touch on later. This means that the vast majority of the show is focused on strong female characters, which is an image that is not shown often enough in popular media.</p>

            <p> Not only does Steven Universe focus on strong women, it focuses on a range of strong women who are all strong because of different reasons. Garnet is the level headed leader who keeps the peace. Pearl is the dedicated mother figure, intent on raising Steven as she imagines Rose Quartz would’ve wanted her to do. Amethyst is the fun-loving, rebellious, strong-willed independent thinker who refuses to be defined any way she doesn’t want to be. Rose Quartz is the moral and ethical compass, still guiding the Gems with her dream of protecting and preserving the beauty of Earth and humanity.</p>
            <p>The other positive image shown by the Gems is body positivity: each Gem is built differently, but they’re each beautiful in their own way. Garnet is tall and curvy, whereas Pearl is small, delicate, and thin. Amethyst is short and curvy. Rose Quartz is depicted as tall and heavier set, indicating her strength as a battle Gem. They are all considered beautiful, and the range of body types shown in the show promotes acceptance.</p>
            <p>This brings us to Connie, one of the most fascinating characters in the show. Connie is introduced as a bookworm with overbearing parents who’s moved around too many times to make any real friends. Steven is described as her only friend. Connie’s background sets her up to be the follower - the secondary character who simply tags along with Steven on his adventures. We figure out pretty quickly, however, that Connie isn’t your average sidekick. She repeatedly jumps into battle alongside Steven and the Gems, despite her lack of powers as a human. She is much smarter than Steven, meaning that he often follows her advice and allows her to take the lead in certain situations. She’s clever enough to find loopholes in her parents rules so that she can continue to hang out with Steven, and even starts training with Pearl, learning how to use Rose Quartz’s sword so that she can be more useful and protect both herself and Steven. Connie proves to be a strong, intelligent, quick-witted leader and best friend, rather than the vanilla secondary character she could have been.</p>
            <p>Perhaps due to his unconventional upbringing, Steven doesn’t conform to stereotypical gender norms. For instance, in one episode, he performs a pop song in makeup and heels to the wild approval of his town and family. He is unafraid to be emotional, to be afraid, to cry. He treats everyone around him with empathy and patience, and seeks to understand rather than control. It’s also interesting to note that all of Steven’s Fusions use She/Her pronouns, even though Steven is male by human standards. Gems don’t have gender, given that they’re aliens formed from gemstones, and therefore would not have instilled society’s traditional gender stereotypes in Steven during his upbringing. This leads us to Steven’s dad, Greg.</p>
            <p>Greg was a rock star travelling and performing when he met and fell in love with Rose Quartz. He gave up his career to stay in Beach City and raise Steven. He lives in his van and runs a car wash service in order to make ends meet. Greg’s role as a Stay at Home Dad not because he didn’t have other options but because he wanted to stay with his son is a positive gender role reversal. He spends most of his time teaching Steven about humanity, which often includes lessons in patience and empathy, helping Steven connect with those around him on an emotional level (something that would stereotypically be the mother’s job to teach).</p>
