            <h1>How Steven Universe has Made a Difference</h1>

            <p>Steven Universe holds a special place in my heart over many of my other favourite tv shows for several reasons.</p>
            <p>First off, the strong female role models shown in the show are incredible. As a child, I was Connie - the smart, strong-willed, independent book worm who sometimes struggled to find friends. In most of the shows I watched as a child, there wasn't really a Connie character for me to look up to - honestly, there weren't that many female characters, period. I wish I had had a Connie character as a child to see myself in; it's difficult to feel comfortable with yourself when you don't see yourself mirrored anywhere in pop culture, and that might have helped me in my early years when I struggled with that.</p>
            <p>More on the subject of not seeing yourself represented: as a queer woman, especially a bisexual woman, I rarely find characters in tv shows or movies that are like me. If there is a queer character, they are often stereotyped and tokenized instead of being developed as a unique individual who also happens to be queer. Steven Universe is one of the first shows I've watched where I can look at the characters, know they're queer just like me, and have them not fall into a harmful stereotype or feel like they're just being shoehorned into the story for the sake of checking off that box. Seeing characters that are like me help me to accept my identity and become more comfortable and confident with who I am. I would love future generations of queer children to grow up with this kind of exposure, rather than discovering it when they're almost 20, like I am.</p>

<p>However, don't just take my word for it. Here's some thoughts from another fan of the show!</p>
<p>WHO IS YOUR FAVORITE CHARACTER?</p>
<p>My favorite character changes a lot, but it generally fluctuates between Garnet and Peridot. I like Garnet because she’s a funny character with her stoicness, but her character development has been one of showcasing her own love and I really enjoy that. She goes from being very cold and calculating to one of the kindest and most openly lovable characters on the show. I really love her deadpan moments, they really make me laugh more than most other characters. I think Estelle does a brilliant job getting all of Garnet’s intonations correct. I love her relationship with Steven especially, I feel like she is the most responsible for him and cares the most for him without any other motive. Pearl has her own motives for loving Steven, but Garnet just loves fully and unconditionally. I love Peridot quite a bit because she’s nerdy and she’s written to just be annoying enough that she’s obnoxious but not so annoying that I dislike her as a character. I actually realy appreciate that because we all have that one friend who isn’t really that cool to be around and they’re kind of annoying but we love them anyway for their qualities. I relate a lot to Peridot’s smartness and constant calculating. I appreciate that’s she’s a character who has learned about the wrongdoings she’s done and has fixed her behaviors to be more kind and warm. I think that’s a rare trait in character development not even just in a kids show, but in any show.</p>
<p>WHICH OF THE MAIN THEMES IN SU SPEAK TO YOU THE MOST?</p>
<p>I’m a dancer, so I really love fusion as a way of showing love, power, and teamwork. When I dance with someone, I feel like I’m being let into an intimate part of their life that can’t be explained by words, and I really like that metaphor for a lot of the relationships shown in SU. I like that fusions can be both good and bad, much like a dancer that has too much control can overpower the other very easily and trap them into the dance they can’t escape. I think fusion in this show is a really amazing visual representation of relationships. Everyone compares fusion to sex, but I don’t really think it should be taken that literally. Sometimes you can change a lot when you let someone into your own life and into your own head, and that’s the reason why fusion is such a big deal; because you’re going into their head. It’s not just something where you’re with them but not symbiotically interacting with them. I think fusion does a wonderful job explaining unhealthy vs. healthy relationships, nonbinary relationships and gender, and the significance of having your own individual dance to interact with someone else. Before you can fuse, you have to make your own individual dance, much like your personality is needed to have a relationship with someone.</p>
<p>WHAT IMPACT HAS SU HAD ON YOU?</p>
<p>One of the most applicable impacts that SU has had on me was that I understood nonbinary/agender identity way more because of Stevonnie. I don’t consider myself a hateful person, but since I am cis, I don’t know a lot about being troubled or questioning identity in an indefinite way like that. But with SU, I understand it perfectly. I love that Pearl and Garnet use “they” as Stevonnie’s pronoun – because they’re literally 2 people, which makes the pronoun a lot more comfortable to use and say instead of automatically assuming it’s a plural.
In terms of a less obvious impact, I would say that it’s made me appreciate the dancing I experience in my life a lot more along with the relationships I form. I feel like SU is such a wonderful and kind show, and it always makes me happy whether it’s the characters, color scheme, or genius plot points. It’s just one of those shows that has so many strong messages, but can survive as a good show without enforcing any morals because it’s creative and enjoyable. I just really appreciate it.</p>
