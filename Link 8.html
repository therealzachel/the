            <h1>How Steven Universe has Made a Difference</h1>

            <p>Steven Universe holds a special place in my heart over many of my other favourite tv shows for several reasons.</p>
            <p>First off, the strong female role models shown in the show are incredible. As a child, I was Connie - the smart, strong-willed, independent book worm who sometimes struggled to find friends. In most of the shows I watched as a child, there wasn't really a Connie character for me to look up to - honestly, there weren't that many female characters, period. I wish I had had a Connie character as a child to see myself in; it's difficult to feel comfortable with yourself when you don't see yourself mirrored anywhere in pop culture, and that might have helped me in my early years when I struggled with that.</p>
            <p>More on the subject of not seeing yourself represented: as a queer woman, especially a bisexual woman, I rarely find characters in tv shows or movies that are like me. If there is a queer character, they are often stereotyped and tokenized instead of being developed as a unique individual who also happens to be queer. Steven Universe is one of the first shows I've watched where I can look at the characters, know they're queer just like me, and have them not fall into a harmful stereotype or feel like they're just being shoehorned into the story for the sake of checking off that box. Seeing characters that are like me help me to accept my identity and become more comfortable and confident with who I am. I would love future generations of queer children to grow up with this kind of exposure, rather than discovering it when they're almost 20, like I am.</p>
