<p>This song is Garnet helping Stevonnie achieve harmony in their Fusion. It features undertones of mental illness (specifically anxiety and PTSD), and the episode as a whole expands on those undertones and deals with them in an extremely healthy and positive way.</p>
<p>The intro is Garnet laying out her philosophy for harmony: flexability, love, and trust. This also makes for a solid foundation for any relationship, which is what Fusion is. The next two verses deal with feeling overwhelmed by anxiety, setting up the mental illness issue. The chorus is Garnet's advice for how to deal with it: take a deep breath, recenter yourself, and remember that everything will be okay because they're together.</p>
