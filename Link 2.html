            <h1>LGBTQ+ Themes</h1>

<p> Steven Universe is one of the best shows for LGBTQ+ representation on television right now, and is by far the best children's show that deals with this theme.
</p>

<p>One of the most immediately noticable and interesting things to note regarding this is that all Gems are female presenting, but when one of them fuses with Steven (such as when he and Amethyst create Smokey Quartz), the fusion uses They/Them pronouns. This representation of Gender Neutral/Gender Fluid/Gender Queer indentities is incredibly important. The normalization of gender neutral pronouns in a children's show helps encourage civility and understanding at a young age, instilling those core values of tolerance when children are the most impressionable.
</p>

<p> The biggest example of positive LGBTQ+ representation is, by far, Garnet herself. It is revealed at the end of the first season that Garnet is not a single gem like Pearl or Amethyst are. Garnet is, in fact, a fusion of Sapphire and Ruby. It is explained that they fell in love and fused because they prefer to be together - Garnet is essentially a physical representation of their relationship. She is also a near-perfect fusion - she does not have extra limbs like most fusions, only an extra eye which is typically covered by the visor she wears. This indicates that the relationship between Sapphire and Ruby is almost perfect, given that the fusion is a representation of their relationship.
</p>

<p> Garnet is the level-headed leader of the Gems, and is well-loved by all the characters (and fans). She's funny, caring, and a strong leader. Because she embodies so many positive traits, viewers associate that positivity with the fusion, casting Sapphire and Ruby's relationship in a very positive light. The fact that Steven Universe is willing to tackle discussions and portrayals of LGBTQ+ relationships, and do it so well, is impressive. Many shows use LGBTQ+ relationships in a negative manner, or tokenize the relationship. Steven Universe portrays it just as they would a heterosexual relationship, and therefore helps to normalize something that is so often degraded and attacked in society today. Just like with the normalization of gender neutral pronouns, the normalization and positive portrayal of Ruby and Sapphire's relationship instills tolerance, understanding, and acceptance in children at a young age, before prejudice and homophobia has been ingrained in them by society.
</p>

<p> This positive portrayal of LGBTQ+ themes has caused the show to come under fire from more conservative organizations, and has also lead to certain scenes being edited or cut entirely from episodes aired overseas. Places like the UK have strict censorship laws, especially regarding childrens shows, which means that many of the LGBTQ+ themes and examples end up removed from the show when it airs in those countries. Unfortunately, this affects the quality of the show since it disrupts character development and the overall storyline. However, thanks to the wonders of the internet, savvy viewers can find the uncensored versions online.
</p>

<p>One of the most interesting concepts that Steven Universe portrays in regards to LGBTQ+ themes is that, technically, you could define the Fusion that is acceptable by Homeworld's standards as "homosexual", given that they only accept Fusion between two Gems of the same type. Ruby and Sapphire would, therefore, represent "heterosexual" Fusion, or Fusion between two Gems of different types. This would make Homeworld "heterophobic". Honestly, I love this flipping of what our norm is (homophobia) and how it creates a commentary on the prejudice without relating any of the usual buzzwords that could set someone off before they truly think about the issue.</p>
