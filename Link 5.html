            <p>The really exciting thing about this song is that it is Pearl being fully open and honest about her feelings for Rose Quartz for the first time. It also deals with Pearl working through her complicated feelings towards Greg, and even towards Steven to a certain degree.</p>
            <p>The chorus is Pearl fully coming to the realization and trying to accept the fact that Rose Quartz is gone and that they can never be together the way that Pearl wants. The second verse deals with Rose Quartz and Pearl's history together, and hints at the special bond they shared as close friends and confidants. The most heartbreaking part of the song is when Pearl asks "why can't I move on" at the very end as she struggles to work through her lingering feelings.</p>
